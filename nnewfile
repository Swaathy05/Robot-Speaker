The Whispering Woods
In a small village surrounded by dense forests, there was a legend about the Whispering Woods. The villagers believed that if someone listened carefully, they could hear the trees sharing secrets and stories from long ago. Many had ventured into the woods, but only a few ever returned with tales to tell.

One day, a curious girl named Elara decided she wanted to uncover the mystery for herself. She had grown up listening to her grandmother's stories about the woods, filled with magic and adventure. Armed with a small satchel of food and her grandmother's old compass, she set off at dawn, determined to find the source of the whispers.
